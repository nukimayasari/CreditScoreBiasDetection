# CreditScoreBiasDetection

This project focuses on bias detection in the **Credit Score Dataset**, using custom implementations of bias detection metrics. The task includes:
- Calculating **accuracy** and **F1 score** for overall and group-specific performance.
- Identifying bias through custom metrics, such as accuracy and F1-score differences and ratios.

## Project Structure
- `credit_score_bias_detection.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation.
- `data/`: Folder for storing datasets (if applicable).

## Metrics Implemented
- **Accuracy**: Measures the overall correctness of predictions.
- **F1 Score**: Balances precision and recall for evaluating model performance.
- **Bias Detection**: Includes differences and ratios of metrics for groups in the dataset.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
